<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project analyzes electric vehicle (EV) charging patterns using a dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to uncover trends and patterns in EV charging behaviors, such as time of day, station usage, and user segmentation, and provide insights through an interactive web application built with Flask.

### Website Functionality
A. **Leaderboard Model Kendaraan Terbaik**  
This feature provides a leaderboard showcasing the most efficient EV models based on factors such as charging patterns, energy consumption, and more. Users can identify the most efficient models tailored to their needs.

B. **Statistik Penggunaan dan Pengisian**  
Displays detailed usage and charging data for each vehicle model, helping users understand the performance of EV models under various conditions and charging behaviors.

C. **Visualisasi Interaktif**  
The results are presented in tables and interactive graphs, allowing users to easily view insights and trends in EV charging behavior.
